20 - 50 images with different features
-> crop so divisible by 8 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- for each run save: original image matrix, DCT coeff matrix, watermark, watermarked image matrix, same for attacker, similarity values and bool values from detector

Begin Analysis with:
- show 4 pictures (original, watermarked, fake original, fake watermarked) for perception test

Analysis per image:
- Fidelity (perceptual similarity between original and watermarked) = 10*log_10(255/MSE) MSE = mean square error between c and similarity
- Average of dct coeff values & esp. of upper left corner
	-> before and after embedding
- difference of pixels and DCT coeffs
- compare difference of both originals to see how close the attacker gets
	
- histogram of 4 images all 3 channels
	-> compare orig & watermarked (original and fake), both watermarked, both originals
	-> average across all pictures and 1 concrete example?
- histogram of DCT coeffs
	-> one with averaged, one with all (x lines)
- Chi square test for the 4 images	on histogram of dct coeffs (Matlab Code)
	-> since it's not an LSB embedding we shouldn't see much here maybe? 
- similarity values from detector, average
- total no. of successful and failed attacks and in which cases (sameseed true or false detector/attacker) -> table
- no. of modified pixels
- Robustness: different jpg compressions/Rotations/filtering and then run through the detector again
	-> different similiarity values
	-> change in values/bools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Can we find images that worked better/worse than others? How?

- Run it again with different payload lengths?
	-> compare robustness, fidelity, no of successful attacks etc. to payload lengths
	-> table with differences
	-> graph with payload length/ no of differences/fideilty/ no of successful attacks / modified pixels
- Test different cases: 1. all 3 have same BBS seed 2. all have different BBS seeds 3. Attacker&Detector have same seed 4. Embedder and Detector have same seed 5. Embedder and Attacker have same seed, detector is different
	-> compare bools and sim. values -> table
