bbs generator for random numbers
both in one algorithm
upper left corner (average light intensity) most sign = highest? Which to take
BBS random selection of DCT coeffs -> only 1 embedder algorithm

detector: knows using BBS, maybe knows concentrate on BBS coeffs. and everything else that is part of the embedder algorithm. 
Algorithm is known, key is not, what is all part of the key? xi, p,q ?key is always small
whenever randommess occurs: potential pseudorandomness -> key has a part for seeding of PRNG
only BBS seeds unknown, not possible to overcome
Attacker: we know it owrks this way, maybe destroys Watermark, embedds pseudorandom signal (white noise) in embedder's way?
-> another original image? close to it
embed random signal -> how does image look?
several copies -> average values (Single and multiple image attack?!)
hash values: copy attack not possible -> discuss
Attack: use own BBS seed -> output?
Maybe delete WM close to original but bit values different

Presentation:
give exercise, then our interpretation of it to justify our procedure
do what we like
if good, we're not getting stopped and he skips some questions
3 questions each, all fields of the lecture, half of lecture is simple
no questions about simple material, if presentation is good
